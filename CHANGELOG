---------------------------------------------------------------------------
24/5  2014 2.4.0    Added support for syslinux GPT MBR.
                    Updated syslinux mbr to version 6.02.

 1/4  2012 2.3.0    Added experimental support for NTFS boot record. This
                    functionality is mostly useful to identify Windows 7 NTFS
                    boot records. Writing an NTFS Windows 7 boot record will
                    most likely not be of much use.

22/1  2011 2.2.1    Modified Makefile to recreate directories lost by CVS
                    Now also doing a sanity check before only writing BPB

13/5  2010 2.2.0    Added support for large disk image files. This version
                    is now considered stable as the BPB problem has had a
                    workaround since version 2.1.5.

14/3  2010 2.1.5    Added support for manually setting the number of heads
                    in BPB

3/10  2009 2.1.4    Win 7 and Vista MBR added
                    Added copyright notice to source files

30/12 2007 2.1.3    Makefile now supports DESTDIR

20/11 2005 2.1.2    Corrected spelling of Gürkan Sengün in man-page and
                    CONTRIBUTORS file.
                    Added a FAQ.
                    Renamed sv_SE.po to sv.po to fix bug described at
                    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336813
                    FreeDOS FAT16 and FAT32 boot records added.

3/8  2005  2.1.1    Now the -p switch also writes the number of heads in BPB.
                    Modified Makefile to work with newer version of gcc.
                    Unfortunately it no longer works with older versions of 
                    gcc as the output from the switch -MM has changed.

26/6 2005  2.1.0    Now ms-sys is able to identify an ms-dos MBR with the
                    undocumented F2 instruction.
                    Fixed bug in Makefile which make Makefile fail to install
                    files unless target directories already exists.

5/6  2004  2.0.0    Now ms-sys should compile cleanly also with a 2.6 Linux
                    kernel based distribution.

21/3 2004  1.1.3    Added switch -p to write needed partition information
                    which might be missing when some format programs are
                    used. The program now supports command line switch
                    concatenation, i e "ms-sys -f2 file" instead of
                    "ms-sys -f -2 file".

16/2 2004  1.1.2    Unofficial contributed version with support for new
                    MBRs and better MBR recognition. Instead of completing
                    the work to make this an official release I choose to
                    merge it into my ongoing work.

4/1  2004  1.1.1    Now compiles even if libintl.h is missing
                    Replaced the -k switch with -l (--wipelabel) with the
                    inverted functionality. This functionality was also
                    implemented for FAT12 and FAT16.

20/9 2003  1.1.0    DOS FAT16 boot record added
                    NT FAT32 boot record added

23/2 2003  1.0.2    Documentation update, man-page added

9/8 2002   1.0.1    Fixed problem compiling sv_SE.po with newer versions of
                    msgfmt

4/8 2002   1.0      First public release. Documentation updated with
                    SourceForge addresses for web and email contact.

30/7 2002  0.9      First stable release
